# ![](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8237355?v=2&s=50) Grav

Grav is a **Fast**, **Simple**, and **Flexible**, file-based Web-platform.  There is **Zero** installation required.  Just extract the ZIP archive, and you are already up and running.  It follows similar principles to other flat-file CMS platforms, but has a different design philosophy than most. Grav comes with a powerful **Package Management System** to allow for simple installation and upgrading of plugins and themes, as well as simple updating of Grav itself.

The underlying architecture of Grav is designed to use well-established and _best-in-class_ technologies to ensure that Grav is simple to use and easy to extend. Some of these key technologies include:

* [Twig Templating](https://twig.symfony.com/): for powerful control of the user interface
* [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown): for easy content creation
* [YAML](https://yaml.org): for simple configuration

# Requirements

PHP 7.3.6 or higher. Check the [required modules list](https://learn.getgrav.org/basics/requirements#php-requirements)
Check the [Apache](https://learn.getgrav.org/basics/requirements#apache-requirements) requirements.Below requirements observed in above website links
1. Web Server (Apache, Nginx, LiteSpeed, Lightly, IIS, etc.)
2. PHP 7.3.6 or higher

# PHP Requirements
* curl (client for URL handling used by GPM)
* ctype (used by symfony/yaml/Inline)
* dom (used by grav/admin newsfeed)
* gd (a graphics library used to manipulate images)
* json (used by Symfony/Composer/GPM)
* mbstring (multibyte string support)
* openssl (secure sockets library used by GPM)
* session (used by toolbox)
* simplexml (used by grav/admin newsfeed)
* xml (XML support)
* zip extension support (used by GPM)
Make sure whether all above modules are present or install properly during PHP installation.

_**To check whether this above are installed or not** _

* you will  find the **php.ini** file  in _C:\xampp\php\php.ini_  configuration file. now open that file in **VS code** and  **ctrl+f** to find the extensions.
```
;extension=openssl.so
;extension=zip.so
```
And remove the leading semicolon. To enable the modules which require modules are missing.

# Webservers
- Grav is so simple and versatile that you don't even need a web server to run it. You can run it directly off the built-in PHP webserver, as long as you're running PHP 7.3.6 or later.

- Testing with the built-in webservers is a useful way to check a Grav install and perform some brief development, but it is not recommended for a live site or even for advanced development tasks. We've outlined how in our Installation guide.

- Even though technically you do not need a standalone web server, it is better to run one, even for local development. There are many great options available:

### Mac
- MacOS 10.14 Mojave already ships with the Apache Web server and PHP 7.1, so job done!
1. MAMP/MAMP Pro comes with Apache, MySQL and of course PHP. It is a great way to get more control over which version of PHP you are running, setting up virtual hosts, plus other useful features such as automatically handling dynamic DNS.
2. AMPPS is a software stack from Softaculous enabling Apache, PHP, Perl, Python,.. This includes everything you need (and more) for GRAV development.
3. Brew Apache/PHP is an alternative approach that allows a fully configurable installation with various PHP versions.

> **Note:** Any one of them should present in your system based on your requirement

### Windows
1. Laragon portable, isolated, fast & powerful universal development environment for PHP, Node.js, and more. It is fast, lightweight, easy-		to-use and easy-to-extend.
2. XAMPP provides Apache, PHP, and MySQL in one simple package.
3. EasyPHP provides a personal Web hosting package as well as a more powerful developer version.
4. MAMP for Windows is a long-time Mac favorite, but now available for Windows.
5. IIS with PHP is a fast way to run PHP on Windows.
6. AMPPS is a software stack from Softaculous enabling Apache, PHP, Perl, Python,.. This includes everything you need (and more) for GRAV development.
7. Linux Subsystem is a great way to Run a linux-like environment on Windows

> **Note:** Any one of them should present in your system based on your requirement
